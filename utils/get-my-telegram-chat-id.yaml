# After you install Camel K, run this file with `kamel run get-my-telegram-chat-id.yaml -p authorizationToken=the-token` (works also with `kamel local run`).
# Then write a message to the bot to have the chat ID in return.

# camel-k: language=yaml

# Write your routes here, for example:
- from:
    uri: "telegram:bots"
    parameters:
      authorizationToken: "{{authorizationToken}}"
    steps:
    - set-body:
        simple: "The ID of this chat is: ${header.CamelTelegramChatId}"
    - to:
        uri: "telegram:bots"
        parameters:
          authorizationToken: "{{authorizationToken}}"
